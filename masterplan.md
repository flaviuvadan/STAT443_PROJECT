# Project masterplan
### Presentation requirements
1. Introduction to linear algebra of NNs
2. Introduction to activation functions
3. Introduction to output distribution
4. Comparison against other methods
5. NN architectures
6. Description of the problem
7. How we implemented this
8. Demo
9. How it learns
10. Optimization
11. Applicability to other areas


### Work distribution
Uniform:

1. Team will work at the same time
2. Team will attempt to understand and document the R code together so they all learn and understand the implementation
3. Presentation website will also be written in a collaborative manner and the R Markdown code implemented as a team
