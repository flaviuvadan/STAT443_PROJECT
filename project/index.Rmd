title: "Introduction"

This website was created to host a presentation for STAT443 - Linear Statistical
Models - a University of Saskatchewan Statistics course. One of the assignments
for the class encouraged students to explore different Statistics topics such
as:


1. Bayesian Linear Regression;
1. Decision Tree;
1. Clustering Methods (K-Means);
1. Support Vector Machines (SVM);
1. A topic related to Machine Learning.

Our group - Jennifer Lam, Braedan Walker, and Flaviu Vadan - decided to practice
using the R Keras library for classifying images of different clothing items.
The presentation is available on this website and is broken down by several
categories:


1. An outline of the problem the group attempted to solve;
1. An overview of different neural network architectures;
1. A section on the linear algebra behind simple/fully-connected neural
networks;
1. A comparison against other methods identified in the literature;
1. Applicability of the group's approach towards classifying clothing items to
other areas.
