**Neural networks** are a class of algorithms that are used to recognize patterns
and learn representations of given data examples with the aim of learning a mapping
between an input and an output. They are modeled after the biological neurons of 
the human brain. Neural networks are based on the general idea of having a collection
of neurons that take in an input (electrical signal) and compute an activation 
(stimulus). Based on whether the activaiton passes a threshold, the neurons fire 
off another signal to subsequent connections (dendrites).

There are multiple techniques for training neural networks such as *supervised*, 
*semi-supervised*, and *unsupervised*. The technique we focused on using is 
supervised learning.

**Supervised learning** aims to train a neural network to perform a specific task,
such as classification and object detection by passing a sample
data point through the neural network and providing the answer at the same time.
This way, the network has the opportunity to learn by computing the loss
(difference) between the given output (correct answer) and its own (temporarily 
incorrect) output.

One of the problems a neural network can solve is **image classification.** There
are different types of classification that a neural network can perform, such
as binary classification - only two possible classes - or classification of
multiple categories - more than two possible classes. Classification of multiple
categories can be applied to numerous problems such as classifying digits from 0 to
9, checking whether an image contains a cat or not, etc. This tutorial focuses
on classifying images of different clothing types.

## Fashion MNIST dataset

The Fashion MNIST data set supplied by the **Keras** R package provides 70000
grayscale, $28 \times 28$ pixel photos of clothing items that fall into one of
ten classes:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 0     | T-shirt/top |
| 1     | Trouser     |
| 2     | Pullover    |
| 3     | Dress       |
| 4     | Coat        |
| 5     | Sandal      |
| 6     | Shirt       |
| 7     | Sneaker     |
| 8     | Bag         |
| 9     | Ankle boot  |

The pixels are then flattened into a $784 \times 1$ image which is then
converted into a numerical observation by analyzing the pixel intensity values
(which will range from 0 to 255).
