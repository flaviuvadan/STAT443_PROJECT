## Other classification approaches {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
### ConvNet
An algorithm that would have been *better suited* to identifying images would be
the **convolutional neural network** (CNN or ConvNet) which specializes in analyzing
visuals and reduces the computational workload while retaining necessary
information. The CNN does this by only having the last layer be fully connected
(whereas the ANN is fully connected in all layers) and pools layers to
streamline any underlying computation.
Our group decided to use the simpler artificial neural network for ease of use.

### Logistic Regression
By comparison to the usage of **logistic regression** which is analogous
to linear regression (since logistic regression is a special case of the
generalized linear model), an artificial neural network can handle more than a
dichotomous outcome.

**Multivariate logistic regression** could also work for image recognition, but a
major downfall of it is that the more parameters there are, the more likely it
is to *overfit* the data.  With a dataset in the tens of thousands, the chances of
the model poorly fitting the data is much higher than if it were only using, say
10 parameters.

### Clustering
Algorithms for **cluster analysis** could also work but they rely more
on finding similarities between subjects rather than learning on its own and
associating a probability from each image to a class. Although it is also an unsupervised learning method, the algorithms separate observations based on predetermined properties.  These clusters can then be considered the equivalent to the ANN's "classes".  The process of calculating weights and finding the best suited one is also similar to that of an ANN.  However, we found that cluster analysis algorithms are less applicable in our case as it is less about classifiying images and more about grouping observations into undefined categories.
