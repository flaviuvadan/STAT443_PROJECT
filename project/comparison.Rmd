An algorithm that would have been better suited to identifying images would be the convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) which specializes in analyzing visuals, but our group decided to use the simpler artificial neural network for
ease of use.

Other machine learning algorithms exist to classify data from images, but we have chosen to use
an artificial neural network for ease of use and better accuracy.  In comparison to the usage of logistic regression which is analogous to linear regression (since logistic regression is a special case of the generalized linear model),
artificial neural networks use a nonlinear function to deal with overfitting or underfitting a model.

Similarly, algorithms for cluster analysis could also work but it relies more on finding similarities between subjects
